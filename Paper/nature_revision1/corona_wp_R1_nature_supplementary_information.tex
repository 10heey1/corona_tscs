The format of the data is in country-day-\texttt{record\_id} format. Some \texttt{record\_id} values have letters appended to indicate that the general policy category \texttt{type} also has a value for \texttt{type\_sub\_cat}, which contains more detail about the policy, such as whether health resources refers to masks, hospitals, or doctors. Some entries are marked as \texttt{new\_entry} in the \texttt{entry\_type} field for when a policy of that type was first implemented in the country. Later updates to those policies are marked as updates in \texttt{entry\_type}. To see how policies are connected, look at the \texttt{policy\_id} field for all policies from the first entry through each update for a given country/province/city. If an entry was corrected after initial data collection, it will read corrected in the \texttt{correct\_type} field (the original incorrect data has already been replaced with the corrected data).

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{RA Training}

In order to register for this data collection effort, RAs watch a mandatory 2 hour video training of the survey instrument which explains how to use the survey to document new policies as well as to update, and correct previous entries.

RAs are also provided with written guidelines on how to collect data and a comprehensive codebook. To briefly describe it here, the written guidelines provide a definition of what counts as a new or updated policy (see the Data Schema section for more details) and provides a checklist for RAs to follow in order to identify and document different policies. In the checklist, RAs are instructed to find policies by checking the sources in the order given in the guidelines to identify policies, to document the relevant information into the survey and to save and upload a document of the source they found for each policy into the Qualtrics survey. Meanwhile, the codebook provides descriptions and examples of the different possible response options in the survey.

Using a training video and the written codebook also has the added benefit of helping us efficiently disseminate the information RAs need to use the survey experiment consistently. Before getting allocated to a country based on language skills and interests, RAs participate in an online test where they are asked a randomized set of questions about how to code different policies. To pass the test, RAs need to get at least 70\% of the entries correct.

Overall, in order to participate as an RA in this project, RAs must fill out a consent form\footnote{See here for the \href{https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeybAW0DC0UE1x2EqLiTifVFuSUxqJLGFB8VI4wVCG61tVYKg/viewform}{link to the form}.} in which:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  They identify themselves.
\item
  They certify that they have viewed the training video and passed the test.
\item
  They certify they have joined the CoronaNet Slack Channel (see section below for more information).
\item
  They certify that they understand that RA responsibilities entail

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    gathering historical data on COVID-19 government policy actions for their country, and;
  \item
    providing daily updates for new government policy actions.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  They certify that they understand they can access the data collection guidelines and codebook or pose their questions on the Slack Channel.
\item
  They certify that they are expected to upload .pdfs of the sources they access to the survey instrument.
\end{itemize}

Once the RA submits the form, they are sent a personalized link to access the survey. With the customized link, we are also able to keep track of which RA coded what entries and when the last policy entry was.

\subsection*{Real-Time Communication and Feedback}\label{real-time-communication-and-feedback}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Real-Time Communication and Feedback}

Once an RA joins the project, they can pose their questions on a CoronaNet Slack channel, which they must join in order to participate in the project. The channel allows any RA to pose a question or raise an issue they may have in using the survey instrument to any of the PIs and allows all other RAs to learn from the exchange at the same time. As such, RAs are able to receive feedback and learn from each other's questions in a timely and centralized manner. Since the data collection effort was launched on March 28, 2020 both RAs and PIs have actively used Slack to communicate with one another. On the Slack channel devoted to asking questions about the Qualtrics data survey in particular, there were more 2600 messages posted by 154 project members at the time of writing.
