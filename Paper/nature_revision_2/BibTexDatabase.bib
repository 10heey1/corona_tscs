	abstract = {The global impact of {COVID}-19 has been profound, and the public health threat it represents is the most serious seen in a respiratory virus since the 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic. Here we present the results of epidemiological modelling which has informed policymaking in the {UK} and other countries in recent weeks. In the absence of a {COVID}-19 vaccine, we assess the potential role of a number of public health measures – so-called non-pharmaceutical interventions ({NPIs}) – aimed at reducing contact rates in the population and thereby reducing transmission of the virus. In the results presented here, we apply a previously published microsimulation model to two countries: the {UK} (Great Britain specifically) and the {US}. We conclude that the effectiveness of any one intervention in isolation is likely to be limited, requiring multiple interventions to be combined to have a substantial impact on transmission.},
