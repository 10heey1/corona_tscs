abstract: "Governments everywhere have implemented numerous policies that have been influential in shaping the COVID-19 pandemic. We present an initial public release of a large hand-coded dataset of over 12,000 separate policy announcements in response to the pandemic across more than 190 countries. The dataset is updated daily, with a 5-day lag for validity checking. We document policies across numerous dimensions, including the type of policy; national vs. sub-national enforcement; the specific human group and geographic region targeted by the policy; and the time frame within which the policy is implemented. We further analyze the dataset using a Bayesian measurement model which shows the quick acceleration of the adoption of costly policies across countries beginning in mid-March and continuing to the present. Furthermore, we find that the rate of policy adoption varied widely across countries, with New Zealand having the fastest response across policy categories and the United States the most gradual."

\newpage
Governments all around the world have implemented an astonishing number and variety of policies in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic in a very short time frame. However, policy makers and researchers have to date lacked access to the quality, up-to-date data they need for conducting rigorous analyses of whether, how, and to what degree these fast changing policies have worked in brunting the health, political and economic effects of the pandemic. To address this concern, in this paper, we present the CoronaNet COVID-19 Government Response Database, which provides fine-grained, dyadic data on policy actions taken by governments across the world since the Chinese government reported the COVID-19 outbreak on December 31, 2019. At the time of writing, the dataset covers the policy actions of `r length(unique(clean_data$country))` countries^[Note, we will include additional countries in future versions of the dataset.] up until `r max(clean_data$date_announced,na.rm=T)`, for a total of `r length(unique(clean_data$record_id))` events. 

With the help of a team of over 260 research assistants in 18 time zones, we are releasing the data on a daily basis. We are implementing a five-day lag between data collection and release to evaluate and validate ongoing coding efforts for random samples of the data to ensure the best possible quality given the considerable time constraints.  More specifically, the CoronaNet database collects daily data on government policy actions taken against COVID-19 across the following dimensions:

+ The type of government policy implemented (e.g. quarantine, closure of schools  [16 total])
+ The level of government initiating the action (e.g. national, provincial)
+ The geographical target of the policy action, if applicable (e.g. national, provincial, municipal)
+ The human or material target of the policy action, if applicable (e.g. travelers, masks)
+ The directionality of the policy action, if applicable (e.g. inbound, outbound, both)
+ The mechanism of travel that the policy action targets, if applicable (e.g. flights, trains)
+ The compliance with the policy action (e.g. mandatory, voluntary)
+ The enforcer of the policy action (e.g. national government, military)
+ The timing of the policy action (e.g. date announced, date implemented)

<!-- The rapid and devastating spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has put in stark relief the previously invisible connections among different countries and people. Our dataset illuminates a countervailing kind of network --- it documents not only what actions governments have taken against COVID-19, but how these actions have targeted other geographical regions and the people and resources within them over time. The data, which is publicly available, will allow us to understand among other things, how the effectiveness of different government policies may vary over time or depending on policy actions taken by other governments.  -->
  
Though government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have inaugurated unprecedented changes in how billions of people live their lives, they draw on the lessons learned from the endless series of pandemics and epidemics that came before. Indeed, the earliest written sources document how ancient Mesopotamian responded to the constant threat of epidemic by, on the one hand appealing to various ``healing goddesses'' and on the other hand, isolating people showing the first symptoms of a disease from others. [@porter2005health, pp. 11-13;@farber2006health;@scott2017against, pp. 98] As time has marched forward, pandemics and epidemics have consistently and dramatically changed the course of human history [@behbehani1983smallpox;@@duncan1996impact;@crosby2003columbian;@ziegler2013black;@jannetta2014epidemics] and governments have continued to implement a variety of policies in response.[@hatchett2007public;@shah2016pandemic;@porter2005health]^[Note that early historical guidelines for responding to epidemics can also be found in a number of early texts, e.g. the Bible contains a number of references to the use of quarantine to address the problem of leprosy including Leviticus 13:46 "As long as they have the disease they remain unclean. They must live alone; they must live outside the camp."] Throughout this all, the collection of and access to reliable data, has helped advance collective understanding of which policies are actually effective in curbing the effects of a given pandemic.[@snow1854cholera;@paneth2004assessing] This is no trivial task given that a policy that is effective in one context may be ineffective in another due to a whole host of potentially conditioning factors, including the pathogenesis of the particular disease [@taubenberger20061918;@kilbourne2006influenza], the characteristics of the underlying population [@farmer1996social;@van2020using;@bootsma2007effect;@hunter2007changing], and the available medical[@bandayrel2013information;@abelin2011lessons] and communication [@chew2010pandemics;@jarynowski2020attempt;@boyd2010use;@galaz2009pandemic] technology at the time.


We believe that the data presented in this paper will be similarly invaluable for helping policy makers and researchers assess how effective different policies are in addressing the spread and health outcomes of COVID-19 [@flaxman2020]. While available research is necessarily preliminary, it suggests that which policies governments have implemented in response to COVID-19 [@ferguson2020report;@goumenou2020covid,@prem2020effect;@singh2020age], when they decided to implement them [@chen2020covid;@koo2020interventions], who they were targeted toward [@arriola2020;@yancy2020covid] and what state capacity they possessed to do so [@anwar2020covid;@corburn2020slum] have all significantly influenced how the virus has affected health outcomes both within and across different country contexts [@anderson2020will;@van2020covid], and which is readily captured by our dataset. Equally important is understanding why countries adopt different policies, with early analyses suggesting that institutional and political factors, e.g. the authoritarian or democratic nature of a country's institutions [@cronert2020democracy] or its level of political partisanship [@allcott2020polarization], play an important role. These findings will not only improve the global response to the current crisis, but can also build an influential foundation of knowledge for responding to future outbreaks  [@barrett1998emerging;@miller2009signature].
 
Meanwhile, given the exogenous timing of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, government policies made in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic constitute the single largest natural experiment in recent memory, allowing researchers to improve causal inference in any number of fields. Indeed, government reactions to the COVID-19 epidemic may forward our understanding of a wide-range of social phenomena, from the evolution of political institutions [@pierson2000increasing;@przeworski1999democracy;@svolik2012politics; @kitschelt2007patrons; @gailmard2019preventing] to the progression of economic development [@meltzer1999economic;@nunn2009importance; @kilian2009not; @noy2009macroeconomic;@correia1918pandemics] and the stability of financial markets [@kindleberger2011manias;@peckham2013economies] to say nothing of what we might learn about what we might learn about environmental economics [@dasgupta2002confronting; @folke2006resilience], mental health [@galea2003trends; @gifford2014environmental], disaster response [@baekkeskov2014pandemic;@boin2016politics] and disaster preparedness [@tierney2007margins;@blaikie2014risk;@burby2006hurricane]. Some initial analyses suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has already led to authoritarian backsliding in some countries [@luhrmann2020], unprecedented shocks to the economy [@coibion2020labor;@atkeson2020will], and serious negative mental health effects for millions of people [@zandifar2020iranian;@qiu2020nationwide]. While scholars have always sought to understand how large-scale historical events have shaped contemporary phenomena, modern technological tools allow us to document such events more quickly and more precisely than ever before.   



<!--
^[In the 1918 influenza pandemic for example, different cities in the United States implemented a variety of different policies to curb the epidemic [@hatchett2007public]. For a general review how societies and states have responded to pandemics in the modern era, see @shah2016pandemic.  For a general review of how ancient states and socieites have responded to pandemics and epidemics, see @porter2005health. Note that early historical guidelines for responding to epidemics can also be found in a number of early texts, e.g. the Bible contains a number of references to the use of quarantine to address the problem of leprosy including Leviticus 13:46 "As long as they have the disease they remain unclean. They must live alone; they must live outside the camp."]

In what follows, we provide a description of the data, as well as an application of the data in which we model policy activity of countries over time. Using a Bayesian dynamic item-response theory model, we produce a statistically valid index that summarizes countries in terms of their response to the pandemic, and further shows how quickly policy responses have changed over time. We document clear evidence of rapid policy diffusion of harsh measures opposing the virus, indicating some of the most extensive evidence of this type of diffusion ever documented. In the methodology section, we provide a thorough discussion of the procedures used to collate the data and to manage the more than 260 research assistants coding this data around the world in real time.


# Results {-}

In this section, we first present some descriptive statistics that illustrate how government policy toward COVID-19 has varied across key variables. We then briefly present our new index for tracking how active governments have been with regard to announcing policies targeting COVID-19 across countries and over time.

## Descriptive Statistics {-}

Here we present some descriptive statistics for key variables available in the data. Table \@ref(tab:desctab) shows the number of records for each policy type (please see Data Schema section for more information on how a policy type is defined), the number of unique countries for each policy type, how many countries are targeted in total by each policy type and the degree to which a given policy must be complied with. We present cumulative totals for the different categories in the data, except for the number of targeted countries, which is an average number. While, we highlight the number of targeted countries in this table, we note that our data also captures other potential geographic targets. For instance, it is possible for a national policy to be targetd toward a particular sub-national province or a provincial policy to be targeted toward a certain sub-provincial regions.

Table \@ref(tab:desctab) shows that the most common government policy implemented in reaction to COVID-19 is external border restrictions, i.e. policies that seek to limit access to ports of entry or exit across different governmental jurisdictions. We find that `r clean_data %>% filter(type == 'External Border Restrictions') %>% select(country) %>% summarize(length(unique(country)))` countries have made `r clean_data %>% filter(type == 'External Border Restrictions') %>% select(type) %>% summarize(n())` policy announcements about such restrictions since December 31, 2019. Meanwhile, the second policy that most countries, by our count `r clean_data %>% filter(type == 'Closure of Schools') %>% select(country) %>% summarize(length(unique(country)))`, have implemented is 'Closure of Schools', of which we document `r clean_data %>% filter(type == 'Closure of Schools') %>% select(type) %>% summarize(n())` such policies. Governments have implemented 'Restriction of Non-Essential Businesses' policies with the second highest frequency; we document that `r clean_data %>% filter(type == 'Restriction of Non-Essential Businesses')  %>% select(country) %>% summarize(length(unique(country)))` countries  have implemented `r clean_data %>% filter(type == 'Restriction of Non-Essential Businesses')  %>% select(type) %>% summarize(n())` such policies. However, we note that a strict comparison of policy types by this metric is not perfect, given that, for example, there may be a need for more individualized policies regarding external border restrictions (given the number of countries which a government can restrict travel access to) as opposed to closing schools. In the next subsection, we provide a more rigorous method of comparing policies while taking their depth into account. 

Meanwhile, our dataset also shows that virtually all countries in the world are a target of an external border restriction, quarantine measure, or health monitoring measure from another country. Moreover, a high percentage of policies documented in our dataset have mandatory enforcement. 



```{r desctab}

clean_data %>% 
  group_by(type) %>% 
  dplyr:::summarize(`Total Number of Policies`=n(),
            `Number of Countries`=length(unique(country)),
              `Average Number of Targeted Countries`=ifelse(any(grepl('All countries', target_country)),
                                                  c(length(unique(unlist(str_split(target_country, ',')))) -1, 202*length(which(grepl('All countries', target_country)))),
                                                  length(unique(unlist(str_split(target_country, ',')))) ) %>% mean,
                `% With Mandatory Enforcement`=round(mean(grepl(x=compliance,pattern="Mandatory")*100,na.rm=T),0)) %>% 
mutate( type=recode(type,
          `Other Policy Not Listed Above`="Other",
          `New Task Force or Bureau`="New Task Force")) %>% 
  select(Type="type",everything()) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Type)) %>% 
 arrange(desc(`Total Number of Policies`))  %>% 

  ungroup() %>%
  knitr::kable("latex",booktabs=T,
               caption="Descriptive Information about the CoronaNet Government Response Dataset") %>% 
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "HOLD_position")) %>% 
  column_spec(1,width="4cm") %>% 
  column_spec(2:5,width="2.5cm")

```

In addition, we can look at the cumulative incidence of different types of policies in our data over time, as we show in Figure \@ref(fig:overtime). The figure shows that relatively easy to implement policies like external border restrictions, the forming of task forces, public awareness campaigns, and efforts to increase health resources came relatively earl in the course of the pandemic. More restrictive policies like curfews, closures of schools, restrictions of non-essential businesses and restrictions of mass gatherings arrived later. 

```{r overtime,fig.cap="Cumulative Incidence of Policy Event Types Over Time"}
 
clean_data %>% 
  filter(!is.na(type)) %>% 
  group_by(type,date_announced) %>% 
  summarize(Policies=length(unique(record_id))) %>% 
  arrange(type,date_announced) %>% 
  mutate(Policies=cumsum(Policies)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
        mutate( type=recode(type,
                     `Public Awareness Campaigns`="Public\nAwareness\nCampaigns",
                     `External Border Restrictions`="External\nBorder\nRestrictions",
                     `Other Policy Not Listed Above`="Other",
                     `Restriction of Non-Essential Businesses`="Restriction of\nNon-Essential\nBusinesses",
                     `Restrictions of Mass Gatherings`="Restrictions of\nMass Gatherings",
                     `Restriction of Non-Essential Government Services`="Restriction of\nNon-Essential\nGovernment Services",
                     `Declaration of Emergency`="Declaration of\nEmergency",
                     `Internal Border Restrictions`="Internal\nBorder Restrictions",
                     `External Border Restrictions`="External\nBorder Restrictions",
                     `Public Awareness Campaigns`="Public\nAwareness Campaigns",
                     `New Task Force or Bureau`="New Task Force")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y=Policies,x=date_announced)) +
  geom_area() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank(),
        strip.background = element_blank()) +
  xlab("") +
  facet_wrap(~type)

```


We can also explore the extent to which other countries are affected by policies that can have a geographic target outside the policy initiator (e.g. 'external border restrictions', 'quarantine') across time. For example, in Figure \@ref(fig:biofe), we map a network of bans on inbound flights to European countries initiated by European countries^[In this paper, the following countries are defined as being in Europe: Albania, Andorra, Armenia, Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Kosovo, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Malta, Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, San Marino, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine, United Kingdom, and the Vatican.] as of March 15, 2020. In the plot, each horizontal line represents a potential geographical target of a flight ban. The vertical lines denote whether there was such a flight ban and the arrow of the vertical line indicates the direction in which the ban is applied.^[See @longabaugh2012 for more information on how to interpret this plot.] The figure shows that by March 15, 2020, the governments of Poland and San Marino had banned all flights into Poland and San Marino respectively while the government of Italy banned incoming flights from China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. Additionally, the governments of Greece and Romania both banned flights from Italy while the government of Albania banned incoming flights from Greece. According to our data, up until this point in time, no other European governments at the national level had banned inbound flights from other countries.^[However, at the provincial level, our dataset documents that the government of the autonomous region of Madeira, Portugal had banned flights from Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Spain, and Switzerland while the government of Sardinia, Italy closed all airports by March 15, 2020.]

# Government Policy Activity Index {-}

In this section, we briefly present our new index for tracking the relative government activity with regards to policies targeting COVID-19 across countries and over time. The model is a version of item-response theory known as ideal point modeling that incorporates over-time trends [@kubinec2019ideal;@jackman2004;@gelman2005;@quinn2002;@barbera2015;@bonica2014], permitting inference on how a latent construct, in this case total policy activity, responds to changes in the pandemic. To fit the model, the different policy types shown in Table \@ref(tab:desctab) were coded in terms of ordinal values, with lower values for sub-national targets of policies and higher values for policies applying to the entire country, or in the case of external border restrictions, to one or more external countries. For instance, internal country policies can take on three possible values: no policy, sub-national policy, or policy covering the whole country. Meanwhile external border restrictions can take on four possible values: no policy, policy targeting one other country, policy targeting multiple countries, and policy targeting all countries in the world (i.e., border closure).  

We employed ideal point modeling because it can be given a latent utility interpretation [@jackman2004]. We assume that each country has an unobserved "ideal point" on a unidimensional space representing its willingness to impose policies, while each policy likewise has a position on the same space. The relative cost of different policies can be thought of as the distance between a country's ideal point and the ideal point of the policy relative to other policies. While the meaning of this implied cost will vary from country to country, it is likely a combination of the social, political and economic costs of implementing the policy at a given time point.

As countries become more willing to pay the implied cost (i.e. the latent distance between country and policy decreases), the country's ideal points/policy activity score will rise and they will implement more policies. This interpretation is similar to the traditional item-response theory approach for analyzing test questions in which students who correctly answer more questions on a test are considered to have higher "ability" [@takane1986; @reckase2009]. Following this logic, we are able to estimate latent country scores that represent the readiness of a country to impose a set number of policies. The implied cost of policies is estimated via discrimination parameters, which indicate how strongly policies discriminate between countries. 

The country-level policy activity score is further allowed to vary over time in a random-walk process with a country-specific variance parameter to incorporate heteroskedasticity [@quinn2002]. Incorporating over-time trends explicitly is very important for capturing the nuances of policy implementation over time. For example, countries that impose more restrictive policies at an earlier date will be rewarded with higher policy activity scores compared to those who impose such policies at a later date. Imposing a given policy when most countries have already imposed them will result in little if any change in the policy activity score. 

The advantage of employing a statistical model, rather than simply summing across policies, is that the index ends up as a weighted average, where the weights are derived from the probability that a certain policy is implemented. In other words, while many countries set up task forces, relatively few imposed curfews at an early stage. As a result, the model adjusts for these distinctions, producing a score that aggregates across the patterns in the data. 

Furthermore, because the model is stochastic, it is robust to some of the coding errors of the kind that often occur in these types of datasets. As we discuss in our validation section, while we are continuing to validate the data on a daily basis, the massive speed and scope of data collection means that we cannot identify all issues with the data in real time. However, the measurement model employed only requires us to assume that on average the policy codings are correct, not that they are correct for each instance. Coding error, such as incorrectly selecting a policy type, will propagate through the model as higher uncertainty intervals, but will not affect average posterior estimates. As our data quality improves, and we are able to collect more data over time, the model will produce more variegated estimates with smaller uncertainty intervals.

Figure \@ref(fig:plotindex) shows the estimated index scores for the `r length(unique(clean_data$country))` countries in our dataset at present, and suggests strong evidence of policy diffusion effects. While information about COVID-19 existed at least as early as January, we do not see large-scale changes occurring in activity scores until March. Furthermore, the trajectories are highly non-linear, with a large number of countries quickly transitioning from relatively low to relatively high scores. This non-linear movement could be due to a variety of factors, including the rapid spread of the virus and policy learning as states observe other states' policy actions. We note that the country that appeared to take the quickest action in the shortest amount of time is New Zealand, as can be seen in Figure \@ref(fig:plotvar) where we show over-time variance parameters for each country.

Of course, a caveat with the index is that we may be missing some possible policy measures that have occurred due to the difficulty in finding them in published sources. However, there is still clear differentiation within the index in terms of when policies were imposed, with some countries starting to impose policies much earlier than others. Furthermore, there is a clear break about March 1st when countries began to impose more stringent policies across the world.

Table \@ref(tab:rankcount) shows the discrimination parameters from the underlying Bayesian model for each policy type. These parameters suggest which policies governments find relatively difficult or costly to implement, and for that reason tend to separate more active from less active states in terms of response to COVID-19. Two of these policies (Closure of Restaurants and Quarantine at Home) were given fixed values in order to identify the direction and rotation of the latent scale, and so their discrimination parameters are not informative. However, the rest of the parameters were allowed to float, which provides inference as to which policies appear to be the most difficult/costly to implement.

We note that these are average values for the sample. Imposing these policies may be less costly for certain countries or for countries that share certain characteristics, such as having smaller numbers of enrolled students or relatively healthy economies. However, it is important to note that we can see these patterns on a world-wide scale.


At the top of the index we see various business closure policies as the most difficult to implement, while school closures are the next most difficult. Closure of pre-schools, though, as opposed to other school types, appears to be relatively less costly for states to undertake, perhaps because pre-schools do not operate on a full-time basis. Internal border restrictions are considered more difficult to implement than external border restrictions, while relatively straightforward policies like public awareness campaigns, health monitoring and opening new task forces or bureaus are near the bottom of the index. Quarantines placing people in external facilities, such as hotels or government quarantine centers, are also estimated as being less costly than quarantine at home (stay-at-home orders).

Given this distribution of discrimination parameters, we believe the index is a valid representation of the underlying process by which governments progressively impose more difficult policies. As states relax policies, we will further gain information about which policies appear to be more costly as we will be able to factor in the duration for which these policies were implemented. Consistent with our findings, we observe that the announced relaxation policies happening at the time of writing in European countries primarily center on businesses and school openings, suggesting that these policies are uniquely costly to keep in place compared to travel restrictions.^[See Doherty, Ben.

# Methods {-}

In this section, we first describe the variables that our dataset provides as well as how they are organized. We then provide detail on the methodology we employed to collect the data. 

## Time-Varying Item Response Model {-}

Our time-varying item response model follows the specification in @kubinec2019. We review that notation here to show how it relates to classical item-response theory as well as the ideal point modeling literature. 

The likelihood function for the model is as follows for a set of countries $i \in I$, items $j \in J$, time points $t \in T$ and ordinal categories $k \in K$:

\begin{align}
	L(Y_{ijtk}|\alpha_{it},\gamma_j,\beta_j) =  \prod_{i=1}^{I} \prod_{j=1}^{J} \prod_{t=1}^{T}
	\begin{cases} 
	1 -  \zeta(\gamma_j \alpha_{it} - \beta_j - c_1) & \text{if } K = 0 \\
	\zeta(\gamma_j \alpha_i - \beta_j - c_{k-1}) - \zeta(\gamma_j \alpha_{it} - \beta_j - c_{k})       & \text{if } 0 < k < K, \text{ and} \\
	\zeta(\gamma_j \alpha_{it} - \beta_j - c_{k-1}) - 0 & \text{if } k=K
	\end{cases}
(\#eq:basic)
\end{align}

In this equation, the time-varying country parameters $\alpha_{it}$, also called person abilities or ideal points, are our estimate of policy activity scores. They are estimated jointly with the item (policy type) discrimination parameters $\gamma_j$ and item difficulty (intercept) parameters $\beta_j$. To address the ordinal nature of the outcome $Y_{ijtk}$, ordinal cutpoints $c_{k}$ are used to model the varying levels of enforcement and geographical targets in the data. The logit function, represented by $\zeta(\cdot)$, maps the latent scale to probability that a given ordinal outcome is chosen. Because we have two separate type of ordered measures (domestic versus international policies) with either three or four ordered categories, we estimate the model jointly as two ordered logit specifications. 

The likelihood in \@ref(eq:basic) is not fully identified due to possible scaling issues with the latent variable $\alpha_{it}$ (i.e., it has no natural units) and due to potential sign reflection (also called multi-modality) where $L(Y_{ijtk})$ could be unchanged even if $\alpha_{it}$ is multiplied by -1. These identification issues are well-known in the literature [@gelman2005], and we resolve them with standard practices. First, we assign a reasonably informative prior distribution on the $t=1$ ideal points:

\begin{equation}
\alpha_{it=1} \sim N(0,1)
(\#eq:id1)
\end{equation}

We also fix the discrimination parameters $\gamma_j$ for two items, quarantines and restriction of restaurants and bars, to opposite ends of the latent scale (+1 and -1). Because both of these variables load on the same side of the scale (i.e. both indicate more policy activity), we reverse the order of the categories for restriction of restaurants and bars. We note that these types of restrictions are not commonly used in traditional IRT, where instead a sign restriction is imposed on all discrimination parameters. We employ the more flexible ideal point specification, which also allows us to test the assumption that all the discrimination parameters load on the same sign (as Table \@ref(tab:rankcount) shows, this is true for all of the parameters). The rest of the parameters are given weakly informative prior distributions:^[A prior is put over the difference of cutpoints, rather than the cutpoints themselves, to reflect the fact that only the differences between cutpoints have any natural scale.]

\begin{align}
\gamma_j &\sim N(0,5)\\
\beta_j &\sim N(0,2)\\
c_k - c_{k-1} &\sim N(0,5)
(\#eq:id2)
\end{align}

Finally, to model the policy scores $\alpha_{it}$ as a random walk, we assign a prior to that is equal to the prior period policy score plus Normally-distributed noise:

\begin{align}
\alpha_{it} &\sim N(\alpha_{it-1},\sigma_i)\\
\sigma_i &\sim E(1)
(\#eq:rwc)
\end{align}

The over-time dimension induces a new source of identifiability issues, which we resolve by fixing the variance $\sigma_i$ of one of the countries (the United States) to 0.1 so that the over-time variance is relative to this constant. This constraint has a similar identification effect to the informative prior on the first period policy activity scores in \@ref(eq:id1).


## Model Convergence {-}

For estimation, we sample from four Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains with over-dispersed starting values using Stan, a Hamiltonian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (HMC) sampler [@carpenter2017]. We run the sampler for 800 iterations, 400 of which are discarded as warmup. While this number of iterations is far less than other MCMC samplers, HMC is far more efficient at exploring the posterior density and we are able to achieve convergence using this number of iterations. 

We assess convergence using split-$\hat{R}$ by fitting four independent chains with over-dispersed starting values. $\hat{R}$ values for all parameters (which totaled more than 40,000) were 1.01 or less (see plot A in Figure \@ref(fig:modelconv)). Plot B in Figure \@ref(fig:modelconv) shows the distribution of effective number of samples for the parameters, which is a way of comparing the auto-correlation in MCMC draws to independent draws without auto-correlation, such as we might obtain from a Monte Carlo simulation. Again, the number of effective samples is quite high, often exceeding the total number of empirical draws. This occurred because Hamiltonian Monte Carlo can produce more informative samples than even a Monte Carlo simulation because it can generate negatively correlated draws that explore the posterior space much more quickly.  We also assess convergence using trace plots, one of which is shown below for the time-varying country policy activity scores for the United States. Strong mixing between chains can be observed in the plot. Finally, we report no divergent transitions or iterations where the sampler reached its maximum tree depth, which are both signs of poor mixing in the chains. For these reasons, we are confident than the sampler reached a stationary distribution and was able to adequately explore the high-density regions of the joint posterior.

## Model Validity {-}

While employing a measurement model ensures robustness to arbitrary data coding errors, it is still necessary to validate the model's over-time process, which imposes some assumptions on how policy activity scores change over time. The use of a random walk implies that policy differences will be relatively stable from one day to the next, which could limit the ability of scores to encompass quick, discontinuous changes [@reunig2019]. While we employ this particular specification because it has been applied previously to a variety of empirical phenomena and because of its relative parsimony, we can partially test for whether it captures changes by estimating a static IRT model for each day in the sample. The corresponding estimates represent cross-sections without any time process imposed. 

Due to the complexity of comparing the estimates, we plot the results for six countries separately in Figure \@ref(fig:timeest). This figure shows that indeed the cross-sectional estimates can show much more discontinuous jumps, though we note at the same time that there appears to be substantial noise in the estimates as they only incorporate information available at a single day. Nonetheless, while the random-walk estimates certainly exhibit less discontinuos change, they do still allow for very quick divergence in policy activity scores, with France and Russia moving from the bottom to the top of the index in the space of only a few weeks.

We note as well that the model is parameterized so that each country has its own variance parameter. This permits the rate of change to vary by country, reducing the concern that the model may be overly restricting change. These variance parameters are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:plotvar), sorted in order of increasing over-time variance. These estimates are themselves substantively interesting, as the United States, which was used as the reference category, has actually one of the lowest rates of over-time change, while some countries like New Zealand, Spain and San Marino witnessed the highest variance in policy activity scores. Because at this time the index only captures increasing numbers of policies, the variance parameters can be given the interpretation of which countries responded in the shortest period of time across a broad array of policy indicators.

## Data Schema {-}

Each policy records at the minimum, the following information: The policy type; the name of the country from which a policy originates. If the policy originates from a province or state, that information is also documented. Future versions of the dataset will also include information on whether a policy was initiated from a city or municipality or another level of government;  the degree to which a policy must be complied with; the entity enforcing the policy; The date a policy is announced, implemented and ends. Note that sometimes policies are announced without a pre-determined end date. In those cases, this field is left blank.

For all policies, the database further documents information about the geographic target of the policy and the human or material target of a policy. Note however, for some policies, the geographic target may be the same as the policy initiator and in those cases can be considered monadic. Where applicable, we also document the directional flow of the policy, and the mechanism of travel. 

All of the information mentioned above is also provided qualitatively via a textual policy description. Additional meta-data that is available for all policies include when the record entered into the database and a link for the information source for the policy. See the appendix for a list of currently available fields in the data, along with a list of external data variables such as country-level covariates that are added in to daily releases, including COVID-19 tests and cases. 

 There is a unique record ID for each unique policy announcement, which we code at the policy sub category type. That is, some policy types are further categorized into sub-categories. E.g. 'Quarantine' can be further classified into one or more of the following sub categories: 'Self-Quarantine', 'Government Quarantine', 'Quarantine outside the home or government facility', 'Quarantine only applies to people of certain ages' and 'Other'. Of the `r length(unique(clean_data$record_id))` such events in the dataset, we have identified `r length(unique(clean_data$record_id[clean_data$entry_type %in% c("correction","new_entry")]))` unique events. That is, some events in the database are updates or changes to existing policies. We link such events over time using a unique ID, which we term the policy ID as opposed to the record ID. An event counts as an update if it deals with a change in either the:

1. Time duration (E.g. A country lengthens its quarantine to 28 days from 14 days.);
2. Strength of an existing policy in terms of either:
   a. quantitative 'amount' of the policy (E.g. A restriction of mass gatherings was previously set at 100 people and now it is set at 50 people)
   b. compliance rules for the policy (E.g. The quarantine used to be voluntary but now its mandatory.) 
   c. who the policy applies towards (E.g. The quarantine used to apply to people of all ages and now it only applies to the elderly.)

A policy counts as a new entry and not an update if it deals with a change in any other dimension, e.g. the qualtitative policy type (e.g. a quarantine used to mandate a stay in a government facility but now quarantine at home is allowed), targeted country (e.g. quarantine upon arrival was mandated for people traveling from China but now these rules also apply to people traveling from Italy) etc. 

## Data Collection Methodology {-}
As researchers learn more about the various health, economic, and social effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is crucial that they have access to data that is reliable, valid, and timely (to the greatest extent possible). We have adopted a data collection methodology that we believe optimizes over all three of these constraints.

To collect the data, we recruited more than 260 research assistants (RAs) from colleges and universities around the world, representing 18 out of the 24 time zones.^[For more information on the individual RAs, please visit http://coronanet-project.org/]  Large social scientific datasets typically rely on experts, coders, or crowd-sourcing to input data. The literature has shown that common coding tasks can be completed via crowd-sourcing [@benoitetal2016; @sumneretal2019], but that there are also limitations to the wisdom of crowds when specific contextual or subject knowledge is required [@marquardtetal2017; @Urlacher2017]. To address these trade offs, we decided to train current students to code our entries, leveraging the benefits of wide-spread recruitment and a diverse pool of country-specific knowledge from across the globe. Data collection started on March 28, 2020 and has proceeded rapidly, reaching `r length(unique(clean_data$record_id))` records as of the date of this article. Each RA is responsible for tracking government policy actions for at least one country. RAs were allocated depending on their background, language skills and expressed interest in certain countries [@Horn2019].^[Note depending on the level of policy coordination at the national level, certain countries were assigned multiple RAs, e.g. the United States, Germany, or France.]

We have also partnered with the machine learning company Jataware to automate the collection of more than 200,000 news articles from around the world related to COVID-19.^[We thank Brandon Rose and Jataware for making the news database available to this project.] Jataware employs a natural language processing (NLP) classifier using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to detect whether a given article is indicative of a governmental policy intervention related to COVID-19. They then apply a secondary NLP classifier to categorize the type of policy intervention (e.g. "declaration of emergency", "quarantine", "travel restrictions", etc.). Next, Jataware extracts the geospatial and temporal extent of the policy intervention (e.g. “Washington DC” and “March 15, 2020”) whenever possible. The resulting list of news sources is then provided to our RAs as an additional source for manual coding and further data validation.

In what follows, we describe in greater detail how RAs document the policies that they identify using our data collection software instrument, and our post data-collection validation procedure. Please refer to the appendix for more information on our procedure for on-boarding and training RAs and our system for communicating with and organizing RAs.


### Data Collection Software Instrument {-}

We designed a Qualtrics survey with survey questions about different aspects of a government policy action to streamline the CoronaNet data collection effort. With this tool, RAs can easily and efficiently document different policy actions by answering the relevant questions posed in the survey.^[See @buthe2020 for an example of a similar use of Qualtrics in collecting data.] For example, instead of entering the country that initiated a policy action into a spreadsheet, RAs answer the following question in the survey: "From what country does this policy originate?" and choose from the available options given in the survey.

By using a survey instrument to collect data, we are able to systematize the collection of very fine-grained data while minimizing coding errors common to tools like shared spreadsheets. The value of this approach of course, depends on the comprehensiveness of the questions posed in the survey, especially in terms of the universe of policy actions that countries have implemented against COVID-19. For example, if the survey only allowed RAs to select 'quarantines' as a government policy, it would not capture any data on 'external border restrictions', which would seriously reduce the value of the resulting data. 

As such, to ensure the comprehensiveness of the data, before designing the survey, we collected in depth, over-time data on policy actions taken by one country, Taiwan, since the beginning of the outbreak as well as cross-national data on travel bans implemented by most countries for a total of 245 events.^[The specific data source we cross referenced for this effort was the March 20, 2020 version of the following New York Times article: Salcedo, Andrea and Gina Cherelus, "Coronavirus Travel Restrictions, Across the Globe" *New York Times*, 20 March 2020, https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-travel-restrictions.html] We chose to focus on Taiwan on because of its relative success, as of March 28, 2020, in limiting the negative health consequences of COVID-19 within its borders.^[Beech, Hannah. "Tracking the Coronavirus: How Crowded Asian Cities Tackled an Epidemic." *New York Times* 18 March 2020, https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/world/asia/coronavirus-singapore-hong-kong-taiwan.html] As such, it seems likely that other countries may choose to emulate some of the policy measures that Taiwan had implemented, which helps increase the comprehensiveness of the questions we ask in our survey. Meanwhile, by also investigating variation in how different countries around the world have implemented travel restrictions, we have also helped ensure that our survey is able to comprehensively document variation in how an important and commonly used policy tool is applied, e.g., restrictions on different methods of travel (e.g. flights, cruises), restrictions across borders and within borders, restrictions targeted toward people of different status (e.g. citizens, travelers).

<!-- As a last step, the team also consulted the ACAPS COVID-19: Government Measures Dataset^[https://data.humdata.org/dataset/acaps-covid19-government-measures-dataset] to validate the comprehensiveness of the policy measures considered in the survey instrument.  -->

<!-- To further address concerns about the comprehensiveness of our data, the survey instrument also allows for a degree of flexibility in learning about new policies that we might not have considered when designing the survey with the use of text entry fields that allows RAs to choose 'Other' categories that. To date, X% of the the data has been coded as 'Other' suggesting that [....]. Please see the descriptive statistics in the Data section for more information.  -->

There are many additional benefits of using a survey instrument for data collection, especially in terms of ensuring the reliability and validity of the resulting data:

1. Preventing unforced measurement error. RAs are prevented from entering data into incorrect fields or unknowingly overwriting existing data---as would be possible with manual data entry into a spreadsheet---because RAs can only document one policy action at a time in a given iteration of a survey and do not have access to the full spreadsheet when they are entering in the data. 

2. Standardizing responses. We are able to ensure that RAs can only choose among standardized responses to the survey questions, which increases the reliability of the data and also reduces the likelihood of measurement error. For example, when RAs choose different dates that we would like them to document (e.g., the date a policy was announced) they are forced to choose from a calendar embedded into the survey which systematizes the day, month and year format that the date is recorded in. 

3. Minimizing measurement error. A survey instrument allows coding different conditional logics for when certain survey questions are posed. This technique obviates the occurrence of logical fallacies in our data. For example, we are able to avoid situations where an RA might accidentally code the United States as having closed all schools in another country.

4. Reduction of missing data. We are able to reduce the amount of missing data in the dataset by using the forced response option in Qualtrics. Where there is truly missing data, there is a text entry at the end of the survey where RAs can describe what difficulties they encountered in collecting information for a particular policy event. 

5. Reliability of the responses. We increase the reliability of the documentation for each policy by embedding descriptions of different possible responses within the survey. For example, in the survey question where RAs are asked to identify the policy type (`type` variable, see appendix and/or Codebook), the survey question includes pop-up buttons which allow RAs to easily access descriptions and examples of each possible policy type. Such pop-up buttons were also made available for the survey questions which code for the people or materials a policy was targeted at (`target_who_what`) and whether the policy was inbound, outbound or both (`target_direction`). Embedding such information in the dataset both clarifies the distinction between different answer choices and increases the efficiency of the policy documentation process (as RAs are not obliged to refer back and forth from the survey to the codebook). 

6. Linking observations. The use of a survey instrument allows us to easily link policy events together over time should there be updates to existing policies. Once coded, each policy is given a unique Record ID, which RAs can easily look up, reference and link to if they need to update a particular policy.



### Post-Data Collection Validation Checks {-}

We further implement the following processes to validate the quality of the dataset:

1. Cleaning. Before validation, we use a team of RAs to check the raw data for logical inconsistencies and typographical errors.

2. Multiple Coding for Validation. Others have shown that the random allocation of tasks and the validation of labels by more than one coder are among the best ways to improve the quality of a dataset [@Sheng2008;@MTurk2011]. We randomly sample 10% of the dataset using the source of the data (e.g. newspaper article, government press release) as our unit of randomization. We use the source as our unit of randomization because one source may detail many different policy types. We then provide this source to a fully independent RA and ask her to code for the government policy contained in the sampled source in a separate, but identical, survey instrument. If the source is in a language the RA cannot read, then a new source is drawn. The RA then codes all policies in the given source. This practice is repeated a third time by a third independent coder. Given the fact that each source in the sample is coded three times, we can assess the reliability of our measures and report the reliability score of each coder.

3. Evaluation and Reconciliation. We then check for discrepancies between the originally coded data and the second and third coding of the data through two primary methods. First, we use majority-voting to establish a consensus for policy labels. Using the majority label as an estimate of the "hidden true label" is a common method to address classification problems [@Raykar2009]. One issue with this approach is that it assumes that all coders are equally competent [@Raykar2010]. This criticism is generally levied at data creation with crowd-sourced laborers. We mitigate this problem by training our RAs in the data collection process and prioritizing RA country-knowledge and language skills, therefore ensuring a more equal baseline for RA quality. In addition, we provide RA ID codes that will allow users to evaluate coder accuracy.

If the majority achieves consensus, then we consider the entry valid. If a discrepancy exists, a fourth RA or PI evaluates between the three entries to determine whether one, some, a combination of all three is most accurate. Reconciled policies are then entered into the dataset as a correction for full transparency. If an RA was found to have made a coding mistake, then we sample six of their previous entries: 3 entries which correspond to the type of mistake made^[e.g. if the RA incorrectly codes an 'External Border Restriction' as a 'Quarantine', we sample 3 entries where the RA has coded a policy as being about a 'Quarantine.'] and randomly sample 3 more entries to ascertain whether the mistake was systematic or not. If systematic errors are found, entries coded by that individual will be entirely recoded by a new RA.

At the time of writing, we are in the process of completing our second coding of the validation sample. Thus far, 297 policies have been double coded---276 double-coded policies after excluding the category 'Other policies' from the analysis---out of the original 500 randomly-selected policies included in our validation set. This is equivalent to 10\% of the first 5,000 policies in the dataset. We will be gradually expanding the validation set until we cover all observations. To evaluate the inter-coder reliability at this early stage of validation, we provide several measures in Table \ref{tab:validation}. We find remarkable heterogeneity in the inter-coder reliability across types of policies. Our coders show a high level of agreement on policies such as 'Restrictions of Mass Gatherings', 'Closure of Schools', 'Restrictions of Non-Essential' and 'External Border Restrictions'. However, the inter-rater agreement score remains poor for some policies such as 'Social Distancing', 'New Task Force, Bureau or Administrative Configuration' and 'Public Awareness Measures'. Further, we detect substantial disagreements across the different health-related measures: health resources (n = 35, k = 0.66), health testing (n = 7, k = 0.08), and health monitoring (n = 10, k = 0.14). Hence, we decide to combine them under the category of 'Health measures' in this on-going validation. Overall, these statistics indicate substantial levels of overall agreement between coders with inter-coder reliability scores above 0.70, although we also acknowledge that some ambiguities remain providing evidence for the utility of our planned ``majority voting'' validation strategy.

# Conclusion {-}

As policymakers, researchers and the broader public debate and compare how to succeed against the novel threats posed by COVID-19, they need real-time, traceable data on government policies in order to understand which of these policies are effective, and under what conditions. This requires specific knowledge of the variation in such policies and the extent of their implementation across countries and time. The goal of the dataset and policy action index presented here is to provide this information.

We have tried to match our data collection efforts to keep up with the exponential speed with which COVID-19 has already upended global public health and the international economy while also maintaining high levels of quality. However, we will inevitably be refining, revising and updating our data to reflect new knowledge and trends as the pandemic unfolds. The data that we present in this first version of the dataset represents only the initial release of the data, and we will continue to validate and release data so long as governments continue to develop policies in response to COVID-19.

In future work, we intend to analyze the policy combinations that are best able to stymie the epidemic so as to contribute to the research community and provide urgently needed knowledge for policymakers and the wider global public.

## Appendix A: Description of Dataset Fields {-}

The format of the data is in country-day-`record_id` format. Some `record_id` values have letters appended to indicate that the general policy category `type` also has a value for `type_sub_cat`, which contains more detail about the policy, such as whether health resources refers to masks, ventilators, or hospitals. Some entries are marked as `new_entry` in the `entry_type` field for when a policy of that type was first implemented in the country. Later updates to those policies are marked as updates in `entry_type`. To see how policies are connected, look at the `policy_id` field for all policies from the first entry through updates for a given country/province/city. If an entry was corrected after initial data collection, it will read corrected in the `entry_type` field (the original incorrect data has already been replaced with the corrected data). 

1. **`coronanet_release.csv`** This file contains variables from the CoronaNet government response project, representing national and sub-national policy event data from more than 190 countries since December 31st, 2019. The data include source links, descriptions, targets (i.e. other countries), the type and level of enforcement, and a comprehensive set of policy types. For more detail on this data, you can see our [codebook here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zvNMpwj0onFvUZ_gLl4RRjqS-clbHv3TIX6EOHofsME).

2. **`coronanet_release_allvars.csv`** This file contains the government response information from `coronanet_release.csv` along with the following datasets:

## Appendix B: Research Assistant Training and Management {-}


## RA Training


All RAs watch a mandatory 50 minute video training of the survey instrument which explains how to use the survey instrument. RAs are also provided with written guidelines on how to collect data and a comprehensive codebook. To briefly describe it here, the written guidelines provide a definition of what counts as a new or updated policy (see Data section for more details) and provides a checklist for RAs to follow in order to identify and document different policies. In the checklist, RAs are instructed to find policies by checking the sources in the order given in the guidelines to identify policies, to document the relevant information into the survey and to save and upload a document of the source they found for each policy into Qualtrics. The codebook meanwhile provides descriptions and examples of the different possible response options in the survey. Using a training video and the written codebook also has the added benefit of helping us efficiently disseminate the information RAs need to use the survey experiment consistently. 

In order to participate as an RA in this project, RAs must fill out a form^[See here for the [link to the form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeybAW0DC0UE1x2EqLiTifVFuSUxqJLGFB8VI4wVCG61tVYKg/viewform).] in which:

* They identify themselves.
* They certify that they have viewed the training video in which we explain how to use the survey instrument.
* They certify they have joined the CoronaNet Slack Channel (see section below for more information).
* They certify that they understand that RA responsibilities entail 
  + gathering historical data on COVID-19 government policy actions for their country, and;
  + providing daily updates for new government policy actions.
* They certify that they understand they can access the data collection guidelines and codebook or pose their questions on the Slack Channel.
* They certify that they are expected to upload .pdfs of the sources they access to the survey instrument.

Once the RA submits the form, they are sent a personalized link to access the survey. With the customized link, we are also able to keep track of which RA coded what entries.

## Real-Time Communication and Feedback

Once an RA joins the project, they can pose their questions on a CoronaNet Slack channel, which they must join in order to participate in the project. The channel allows any RA to pose a question or issue they may have in using the survey instrument to any of the PIs and allows all other RAs to learn from the exchange at the same time. As such, RAs are able to receive feedback and learn from each other's questions in a timely and centralized manner. Since the data collection effort was launched on March 28, 2020 until April 18, 2020, both RAs and PIs have actively used Slack to communicate with one another.  On the Slack channel devoted to asking questions about the Qualtrics data survey in particular, there were 1,752 messages posted by 130 project members. 

<!---To provide a better sense of the level of activity on Slack, Figure \@ref(fig:members) plots the number of project members who had logged into the Slack per day as well as the number of project members who posted at least one message per day and shows that participation and activity Slack  has steadily grown over time.^[Note, the dip in the overall trend corresponds to weekend days.]
