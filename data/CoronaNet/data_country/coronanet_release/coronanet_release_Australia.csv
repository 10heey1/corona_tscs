The three-step plan provides a pathway for jurisdictions to move towards COVID safe communities in a way that best suits their individual circumstances. States and territories are able to move between the steps on the pathway at different times, in line with their current public health situation and local conditions.

Step 1 will focus on carefully reopening the economy, and giving Australians opportunities to return to work and social activities, including gatherings of up to 10 people, up to 5 visitors in the family home and some local and regional travel.

Step 2 builds on this with gatherings of up to 20, and more businesses reopening, including gyms, beauty services and entertainment venues like galleries and cinemas.

Step 3 will see a transition to COVID safe ways of living and working, with gatherings of up to 100 people permitted.

On 18 March 2020, the National Cabinet followed up on this advice by affirming that outdoor events of fewer than 500 attendees may proceed. However, general measures should be implemented that include:

In a given occupied space, there must be no more than one person per four square metres of ground space and; 
Availability of hand hygiene products and suitable waste receptacles, with frequent cleaning and waste disposal.

Food markets are exempt from the 500 person limit, however must undertake additional measures, such as control of patronage level numbers or stall density reduction to decrease the risk of COVID-19 transmission.

There may be other gatherings that are considered essential and it is at the discretion of the individual state and territory Chief Medical Officers or equivalent to assess each on their merits, and determine whether they can continue if mitigated by social distancing measures.","2020-03-13","2020-03-16",NA,"Australia","AUS","AU","National",0,NA,NA,"Restrictions of Mass Gatherings","Postponement of a recreational or commercial event",NA,"","Australia",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"All Residents (Citizen Residents + Foreign Residents)",NA,NA,"Mandatory with Exceptions (Please list exceptions in the text entry)","National Government,Ministry/Department of Health,Provincial/State Government",50.8586773557478,49.6858586019451,48.2842750806351,49,"https://www.pm.gov.au/media/advice-coronavirus","2020-06-17","2020-06-17 18:04:09"

All crossbench and independent Members and Senators will be able to attend, should they want to. In the House there will be 30 pairs. In the Senate, arrangements will be finalised in consultation with the Opposition and the Senate crossbench in coming days.

- Pairs will be determined in the normal ways, in particular considering parliamentarians’ welfare. If a parliamentarian is sick or self-isolating or consideration needs to be given to the welfare conditions of their communities, pairs will be made. Government and Opposition whips will also work to minimise the number of members and senators from remote areas or who have the longest travel requirements.
