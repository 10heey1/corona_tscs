This ensures that critical national needs are met, and will help laboratories manage workloads so that capacity is not overwhelmed by sudden surges in demands. We seek our laboratories’ cooperation in working closely with the TOC to achieve this.

 Laboratory testing is a critical enabler of the fight against COVID-19. It supports clinical diagnosis so that appropriate treatment can be provided to those who are unwell. It also enables active case finding and regular community surveillance, so that community transmissions can be ringfenced quickly to prevent the formation of large clusters. Testing is also currently used in a targeted way to monitor and protect vulnerable groups such as our seniors, healthcare workers and frontline officers managing COVID-19 cases.

Religious leaders should advise their followers to adhere to similar measures, even if such activities are not held on the premises of the religious organisation.
The limit of 10 persons at any one time does not apply in workplace situations in places of worship where religious and administrative staff/volunteers are performing their duties (e.g. providing pastoral services, setting up live streams of religious services).
