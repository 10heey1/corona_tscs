05.10.2020: As many await the reopening of our external borders, I hasten to say that while this is imminent, we are not there yet. Borders were closed to prevent the spread of the virus and to save lives, and for now, we must maintain that status quo. At the most recent meetings of Caricom and OECS leaders, we collectively agreed to start gradually relaxing the restrictions for travel, as the pandemic in the region has been largely contained. Governments, airlines and hotels are now finalising the details of this phased reopening. Assuming that the requisite protocols are in place, we expect to open our borders in the first week of June. I assure you, fellow Grenadians, we will not move unless we are satisfied that adequate health and safety guidelines are in place.","2020-05-10","2020-05-10",2020-06-09,"Grenada","GRD","GD","National",0,NA,NA,"External Border Restrictions","Visa extensions (e.g. visa validity extended)",NA,"","All countries","All countries",NA,NA,NA,NA,"All Travelers (Citizen Travelers + Foreign Travelers )","Inbound","Cruises","Mandatory with Legal Penalties (Jail Time),Mandatory with Fines","National Government",NA,NA,NA,NA,"https://www.mgovernance.net/grenada-cruise-ship-advisory-march-16-2020","2020-05-11","2020-05-11 08:06:10"
