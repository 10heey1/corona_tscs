Those who successfully register in the human resources bank will be able to address teacher shortages within schools if teachers are infected by COVID-19. In addition to temporary teachers, this human resources bank aims to assemble 550 learning instructors to assist with after-school supplementary classes and 140 school support staff to help with class preparations.

This human resources bank was established separately to the National Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology's human resources bank.
