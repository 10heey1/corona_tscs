The new emergency measures are to save lives and to protect The Bahamas, and are included in the Emergency Powers (COVID-19) Regulations, 2020, passed in the House of Assembly on Wednesday 18 March.
 
The major components of the Regulations include:
 
Health Officers have been empowered to take certain actions to prevent the spread of the disease
Where a health officer believes that someone is infected, they may order such a person detained for screening and assessment.  The officer is also empowered to impose the necessary restrictions of movement to prevent further spread of infection.
Where the infected is a minor, a parent or guardian will be responsible for ensuring compliance with any restriction of movement.
A health officer can order isolation on reasonable grounds in order to prevent further spread of the disease.
Public gatherings may be restricted
Under the emergency proclamation, permits for use of public spaces can be suspended nationally in the interest of public safety. This suspension can cover an assembly of as little as two persons in public areas.
Public movement may be restricted
The Prime Minister may also impose isolation or confine persons to their homes. Under these circumstances, all educational and religious institutions would be closed.
