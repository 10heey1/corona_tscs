If, for reasons attributable to the coronavirus epidemic, a demonstration of the professional skills and competence required to pass a qualification module cannot be conducted in authentic work situations and processes, a student may demonstrate his or her professional skills and competence by performing other practical tasks that are as similar to authentic work situations and processes as possible. In addition, the demonstration of skills and competence can be supplemented with other types of competence assessment more flexibly than at present.

In higher education institutions, a student may register as a non-attending student during the first academic year if he or she is prevented from starting his or her studies due to an official regulation related to the epidemic or for another epidemic-related serious reason. If studies are delayed due to exceptional teaching arrangements introduced by a higher education institution because of the coronavirus epidemic, this will be taken into account when deciding on the extension of the right to study. The amendments made to the Act on Vocational Education and Training, the Universities Act and the Universities of Applied Sciences Act will remain in force until 31 July 2021.""",2020-08-04,2020-08-04,2021-07-01,"Finland","FIN","FI","National",1,NA,NA,"Closure and Regulation of Schools","Higher education institutions (i.e. degree granting institutions)",NA,"Higher education institutions allowed to open with conditions","Finland",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"All Residents (Citizen Residents + Foreign Residents)",NA,NA,"Voluntary/Recommended but No Penalties","Ministry/Department of Education",NA,NA,NA,NA,"https://minedu.fi/en/-/updated-recommendations-for-early-childhood-education-and-care-schools-educational-institutions-and-higher-education-institutions-to-prevent-the-spread-of-the-coronavirus",2020-10-14,2020-10-14 13:49:46
