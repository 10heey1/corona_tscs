   From 17.5. the quarantine is no longer mandatory for people travelling from other EU countries, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland, and the UK as long as there have not been more than 50 cases per 100.000 inhabitants in the respective country in the average of the last seven days. Also, from 17.5. on, people are not allowed to enter Schleswig-Holstein for working if they have been in a country that would require quarantine under this law for Schleswig-Holstein residents.
   From 15.6. on, only people who have been in a ""risk country"" within the last 14 days have to quarantine. The classification as a risk country is carried out by the federal government. Now, a new exception from the quarantine is to provide a negative test that was made 48h before entry at the latest.
