On 18 March 2020, the National Cabinet followed up on this advice by affirming that outdoor events of fewer than 500 attendees may proceed. However, general measures should be implemented that include:

In a given occupied space, there must be no more than one person per four square metres of ground space and; 
Availability of hand hygiene products and suitable waste receptacles, with frequent cleaning and waste disposal.

Food markets are exempt from the 500 person limit, however must undertake additional measures, such as control of patronage level numbers or stall density reduction to decrease the risk of COVID-19 transmission.

There may be other gatherings that are considered essential and it is at the discretion of the individual state and territory Chief Medical Officers or equivalent to assess each on their merits, and determine whether they can continue if mitigated by social distancing measures.
