These Principles provide guidance about how operators can run services as safely as possible for
passengers and workers. 

Physical distancing measures are highlighted in the document and operators are urged to introduce measures to assist all workers maintain physical distancing, where possible, for example by: avoiding sharing equipment, reducing the time workers spend in close contact with passengers and each other, restricting access to areas immediately around drivers, e.g. the first row of seats, amending responsibilities for on-board attendants to limit physical contact with passengers, consider employing additional staff to assist customers manage physical distancing. 

Operators should also encourage passengers to optimise physical distancing to the extent possible for example by: limiting passenger numbers, amending booking systems to restrict seat availability, introducing adequate signage to inform passengers of physical distancing measures, managing passenger’s entering and exiting of vehicles to limit unnecessary contact.
