## About This Repository

This repository contains data from the [CoronaNet data collection project](http://coronanet-project.org)  and also data and code to fit the model described in "A Retrospective Bayesian Model for Measuring Covariate Effects on Observed COVID-19 Test and Case Counts", [link here](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jp4wk). Following is first a list of data for the CoronaNet project, with data dictionary, and subsequently a list of files relevant to "A Retrospective Bayesian Model for Measuring Covariate Effects on Observed COVID-19 Test and Case Counts".

On the [CoronaNet Update Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h5dqVxLghvXr2wwl74ZUeSIWRQLySrxWCjD65_MevUM/edit#gid=0), you can track our policy updates by country and subnational unit.

The following plot shows our policy activity index, a set of scores produced by a dynamic measurement model from our data. It is also included in the data release and is a helpful way to reduce the data to a single score. It also permits more straightforward inter-country comparisons.

# CoronaNet Data

First, CoronaNet data releases:

**Please note that while we make every effort to validate this data, the speed and scale with which it was collected means that we cannot validate all of it. If you find an error in the data, please file an issue on this Github page.**

The format of the data is in country-day-`record_id` format. Some `record_id` values have letters appended to indicate that the general policy category `type` also has a value for `type_sub_cat`, which contains more detail about the policy, such as whether health resources refers to masks, ventilators, or hospitals. Some entries are marked as `new_entry` in the `entry_type` field for when a policy of that type was first implemented in the country. Later updates to those policies are marked as updates in `entry_type`. To see how policies are connected, look at the `policy_id` field for all policies from the first entry through updates for a given country/province/city. If an entry was corrected after initial data collection, it will read corrected in the `entry_type` field (the original incorrect data has already been replaced with the corrected data). 

1. **`data/CoronaNet/coronanet_release.csv`** This file contains variables from the CoronaNet government response project, representing national and sub-national policy event data from more than 140 countries since January 1st, 2020. The data include source links, descriptions, targets (i.e. other countries), the type and level of enforcement, and a comprehensive set of policy types. For more detail on this data, you can see our [codebook here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zvNMpwj0onFvUZ_gLl4RRjqS-clbHv3TIX6EOHofsME).

2. **`data/CoronaNet/coronanet_release_allvars.csv`** This file contains the government response information from `coronanet_release.csv` along with the following datasets:

    a. Tests from the CoronaNet testing database (see http://coronanet-project.org for more info);
    b. Cases/deaths/recovered from the JHU data repository (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19);
    c. Country-level covariates including GDP, V-DEM democracy scores, human rights indices, power-sharing indices, and press freedom indices from the Niehaus World Economics and Politics Dataverse (https://niehaus.princeton.edu/news/world-economics-and-politics-dataverse)

# A Retrospective Bayesian Model for Measuring Covariate Effects Data and Code

Files to reproduce the paper:

 1. **`retrospective_model_paper/corona_tscs_betab.stan`**: This Stan model contains a partially-identified model of COVID-19 that permits relative distinctions to be made between areas/countries/states' infection rates. The parameter `num_infected_high` indexes the infection rate by time point and country. As the latent process is on the logit scale, it must be converted via the inverse-logit function to a proportion. However, the resulting estimate should not be interpreted as the total infected in a country, but rather a relative ranking of which countries/areas are the most infected up to the current time point.
 
 2. **`retrospective_model_paper/corona_tscs_betab_scale.stan`**: This Stan model extends the partially-identified model with the 10% lower threshold for tests to infections ratio described in the paper. This model will produce an estimate for `num_infected_high` that when converted with the inverse-logit function will represent the proportion infected in a country conditional on the model's prior concerning the tests to infections ratio.
 
 3. **`retrospective_model_paper/kubinec_model_preprint.Rmd`**: A copy of the paper draft with
    embedded R code. You can access fitted Stan model objects to compile the paper here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1cTCQTAjH8I-11jp3CEdIJZ0NaGRAn8dT. Otherwise all Stan models must be re-fit to compile the paper.
    The process will take approximately 2 hours.
 
 4. **`retrospective_model_paper/kubinec_model_SI.Rmd`**: This file contains an Rmarkdown file with embedded R code showing how to simulate the model. It is the supplementary information for the paper. See the compiled .pdf version as well.
 
 4. **`data`**: The data folder contains CSVs of tests and cases for US states and other data that were used to fit the models in the paper. 
 
 5. **`retrospective_model_paper/BibTexDatabase.bib`**: This file contains the Bibtex bibliography for the paper.
