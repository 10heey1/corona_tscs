## Background 

- The explosion in research on COVID-19 has led to numerous studies trying to understand both the *causes of* COVID-19 and the *effects of* COVID-19 on social-scientific variables:
  - Partisanship
  - Wealth/inequality
  - Public protest (aka "George Floyd" protests)
- It is difficult to employ traditional statistical methods to study COVID-19 due to well-known biases:
  - Observed cases only a fraction of true infections. 
  - Asymptomatic cases never tracked.
  - Limited testing obscures scale of outbreak.
  
## Approach

- We designed a Bayesian Stan-based model to use empirical information to identify the effects of covariates on the spread of COVID-19 among the 50 US states.

- In contrast to existing approaches (SEIR/SIR), we do not attempt to forecast the disease, but rather to extrapolate from known data.

- We use CDC serology surveys to identify a latent-variable model so that we can provide intelligible answers to social-scientific questions concerning COVID-19.

## Structural Model

```


## Some Math I

We want to know the infection rate, $I_{ct}$ given the case count $a_{ct}$ and test count $q_{ct}$. Assume that:

- We can model $a_{ct}$ and $q_{ct}$ as beta-binomial proportions of state populations $c$. 
  - $q_{ct} \sim \operatorname{Beta-Binomial}(c_p, g(\alpha_2 + \beta_qI_{ct}), \phi_q),$
  - $a_{ct} \sim \operatorname{Beta-Binomial}(c_p, g(\alpha_3 + \beta_a I_{ct}), \phi_a)$
  - $g(\cdot)$ is the inverse logit function
  - $\beta_a$ and $\beta_{cq}$ are parameters relating the increase in infection rates to observed date (observation bias)

## Some Math II

$I_{ct}$ is defined as a latent variable with it's own separate equation:

$I_{ct}$ = $g(\alpha_I + \beta_X X_{ct})$

where $X_{ct}$ are a set of covariates for which we want to know their effect on the latent infection rate.

## Some Math III

- Main problem is identification: $I_{ct}$ could either increase or decrease, and true infection rate at time point $t$ is unknown.
- Solution:
  - Use CDC data as informative (very tight) priors (12 serology surveys).
  - For all later days in the sample, assume that the ratio of cases/infected is between 2 and 20 (log-normal prior on the ratio).   

## Data

- We add in a whole set of covariates:
  - Health covariates from United Health Foundation (PM$_{2.5}$, public health funding, No. healthcare providers, No. cardiovascular deaths, smoking rates)
  - Census: % foreign-born, % < 18
  - 2019 state-level GDP per capita
  - Google mobility data (residential, retail, workplace, transit, parks)
  - 2016 Trump vote share
  
## Moar Data

- Yet more:
  - Daily Trump approval polls by state from Civiqs
  - YouGov mask poll April 29th showing mask-wearing prevalence by state
  - Social justice protests following George Floyd's death (% state population)
  - CoronaNet policy data: lockdowns, social distancing, mass gatherings, business restrictions, government restrictions, testing policies
