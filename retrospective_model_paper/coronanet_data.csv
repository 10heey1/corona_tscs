Below are the interim steps the Governor announced are effective at 8:00 a.m. on Friday, May 8:

    Small business retailers will be allowed to do business using curbside pickup as long as social distancing can be maintained.  These retailers include:
        Clothing stores
        Shoe stores
        Sporting goods, hobby, musical instruments
        Book, periodical, music stores
        Department stores
        Tobacco and Vape
        Other general merchandise
        Office supply, stationery, and gift stores
        Used merchandise stores
        Consumer goods rental
    Jewelry stores may do business by appointment only, and the Governor has instructed the Division of Small Business to consider additional changes like this for other similar retailers.
    Cosmetology: Hair care services only are permitted to be offered, and only to workers at essential businesses. Guidelines include:
        No more than two appointments at a time per location (and never more than the number of available staff, so just one for a sole proprietor). Need to leave 15 minutes between appointments for proper cleaning.
        Employees and customers must wear cloth face masks at all times, and customers must cancel appointments if they have any reason to believe they may be ill or may have come into contact with the virus.
        Staff must wear disposable gloves when providing services and must throw away gloves between customers and wash hands.
        Employer must require employees to report their temperature daily — above 99.5 means they are ineligible to work.
        Customer stations must be sanitized between use, along with any equipment used for the customer. In addition, any item a customer handles (like a magazine) must leave with the customer.
        Entrance door must remain locked to outside to prevent walk-ins.
    Other

        Golf carts allowed at courses for 1 rider at a time with proper cleaning between customers
        Drive-in movies are permitted, but patrons must remain inside vehicles and social distancing must be maintained at all times.

Lee said today’s announcement is the first step in a phased reopening of the state’s economy, which entails rebooting industries as they are safe to pursue in 89 of the state’s 95 counties. The state is working with Shelby, Madison, Davidson, Hamilton, Knox, and Sullivan on plans to reopen businesses in those counties. Lee added that many Tennesseans are facing not just potential sickness but crippling financial hardship, particularly in the service industries.

Lee announced Tennessee restaurants are able to reopen Monday at 50 percent occupancy. Additionally, Tennessee retailers are able to reopen on Wednesday at 50 percent occupancy. The state recommends that employees in both industries wear cloth face coverings and that business owners follow federal guidelines for hygiene and workplace sanitation standards related to the pandemic.

Nashville, Tenn. – Tennessee’s Economic Recovery Group released guidance for close contact services today, enabling over 38,000 workers to resume business in 89 of the state’s 95 counties on May 6. Six counties – Shelby, Madison, Davidson, Hamilton, Knox and Sullivan – will create individual plans in consultation with their locally-run health departments.

“As we continue a measured reopening of the economy, it’s critical we provide evidence-based guidance to businesses so they can keep their employees and customers safe,” said Tennessee Governor Bill Lee. “The very nature of close contact businesses calls for strong solutions and we’re inspired by the willingness of these small business owners to take the Tennessee Pledge. These guidelines will allow thousands of businesses to reopen, put their employees back to work, and serve customers in a thoughtful and safe manner.”

In addition to the recommendations included within the Tennessee Pledge, the State recommends strict adherence to CDC guidelines.

Executive Order 23 – Requiring Tennesseans to Remain at Home

Gov. Lee will sign Executive Order 23 requiring that Tennesseans stay home unless they are carrying out essential activities as data shows an increase in citizen movement across the state.

Data from the Tennessee Department of Transportation analyzed traffic patterns for March 2020. While safer at home measures and further restrictions on businesses showed a steep drop-off in vehicle movement from March 13-29, data beginning on March 30 indicates travel is trending upwards, again.

The Administration also analyzed data from Unacast to understand cell phone mobility and determine movement trends among people. Unacast indicates the movement of Tennesseans is trending toward pre-COVID-19 levels.

The executive order remains in effect until April 14, 2020 at 11:59 p.m. Additional information is available here.",2020-04-02,2020-04-02,2020-04-14,United States of America,USA,US,Provincial,0,Tennessee,NA,Quarantine,General,NA,NA,United States of America,A geographical or administrative unit within a country,NA,Tennessee,NA,NA,13,NA,Not Applicable,Mandatory (Unspecified/Implied),"Provincial/State Government,Police",52.81663278322325,51.98982656256438,51.317712668323026,59,https://www.tn.gov/governor/covid-19/covid-19-daily-bulletin/2020/4/2/covid-19-bulletin--11---april-2--2020.html,2020-07-14,2020-07-14T12:58:13Z

All places of public amusement, whether indoors or outdoors, including but not limited to, locations with amusement rides, carnivals, amusement parks, water parks, trampoline parks, aquariums, zoos, museums, arcades, fairs, pool halls, children’s play centers, playgrounds, theme parks, any theaters, concert and music halls, adult entertainment venues, racetracks, and other similar businesses.

All personal care and grooming businesses, including but not limited to, barber shops, beauty salons, nail salons, spas, massage parlors, tattoo parlors, and other similar businesses.

All malls, except for stores in a mall that have a direct outdoor entrance and exit that provide essential services and products as provided by the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) guidelines.

Businesses closed to the public as listed in the order can conduct necessary activities such as payroll, cleaning services, maintenance or upkeep as necessary.

Any business not covered by the guidance from the CISA discussed in Section 3 of the order and not ordered to temporarily close must reduce operations to continue with minimum contact with members of the public and essential employees, while requiring proper social distancing, adhering to the 10-person limitation on gathering size. 

Early learning centers and child care facilities adhering to the guidance issued by the Louisiana Department of Education and Office of Public 
Health may continue to operate.

Examples of Essential Worker Functions under the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) guidelines include:

Healthcare workers and caregivers;
Mental health and Social Service workers;
Pharmacy employees;
Workers supporting groceries, pharmacies and other retail sales of food and beverage products;
Restaurant carryout and quick-serve food operations and food delivery employees;
Farm workers;
Electricity and Utility Industry Employees;
Critical Manufacturing Employees (medical supply chains, energy, transportation, food, chemicals);
Petroleum, Natural and Propane Gas Workers;
Transportation and Logistics Workers;
Communications and Information Technology Employees;
Financial Services and Banking Industry Employees.

Members of the public will still be allowed to go to grocery stores and pharmacies to pick up food, medicine and necessary supplies, go to their essential jobs and to go outside for exercise and fresh air. When leaving their home, people should practice social distancing.""

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. – Tennessee Governor Bill Lee announced free COVID-19 testing will be available for any Tennessean, regardless of traditional symptoms, as the Unified-Command group ramps up an aggressive effort to expand testing capacity across the state.
   
   “As we look to reboot our state’s economy, we must have a greater understanding of how this virus is operating in Tennessee,” said Gov. Lee. “Expanding our COVID-19 testing capacity allows more Tennesseans to have improved access to testing which will empower citizens to make informed health decisions.”
   
   In recent weeks, states across the country have grappled with the availability of tests and supplies needed to conduct COVID-19 tests, as well as the backlog for processing tests. Rapid improvements to the testing apparatus allowed the Unified-Command Group, comprised of the Tennessee Department of Health, Tennessee Department of Military and Tennessee Emergency Management Agency (TEMA), to develop expanded capacity and offer targeted testing across the state.
   
   “Our clinical understanding of COVID-19 is changing rapidly and we need every Tennessean who isn’t feeling well, even outside of the traditional COVID-19 symptoms of cough, fever or difficulty breathing, to come out and get tested,” said Tennessee Department of Health Commissioner Dr. Lisa Piercey.
   
   The expanded testing effort launches this weekend, April 18-19, 2020, with the Tennessee National Guard popping up 15 drive-through testing sites across the state. Drive-through testing sites will also be available during the weekends of April 25-26 and May 2-3.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. – Tennessee Governor Bill Lee’s Unified Command Group (UCG) is announcing today a mass COVID-19 testing initiative will begin next week for all Tennessee Department of Correction (TDOC) staff and the inmates in their care.

Lee. “Thanks to our increased capacity, we’ll test all inmates and staff statewide in order to take appropriate actions to safeguard the health of these vulnerable individuals.”

Today, TDOC confirmed more than 1,246 COVID-19 positive cases, out of 2,450 total tests, among staff and inmates at the Trousdale Turner Correctional Center in Trousdale County, following a targeted testing event at the facility that began on April 28.",2020-05-01,2020-05-01,2020-09-03,United States of America,USA,US,Provincial,0,Tennessee,NA,Health Testing,General,NA,NA,United States of America,NA,NA,Tennessee,NA,NA,13,NA,NA,Voluntary/Recommended but No Penalties,"Provincial/State Government,Other (Please specify in the text box)",NA,NA,NA,NA,https://www.tn.gov/governor/news/2020/5/1/covid-19-unified-command-group-to-launch-mass-testing-strategy-of-state-s-prison-population-and-staff-.html,2020-05-12,2020-05-12T15:33:44Z

and for time sensitive conditions. 
Additionally, the order states dental visits, procedures and surgeries shall only be performed under the following conditions:

WILMINGTON, Del. – Governor John Carney on Wednesday announced a partnership with the Delaware Division of Public Health (DPH), the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS), the Delaware Emergency Management Agency, the Delaware Department of Agriculture, Westside Family Healthcare, local hospital systems, poultry industry employers, Federally Qualified Health Centers, and trusted community partners to stand up community testing sites in Sussex County, and increase outreach and distribution of educational materials about COVID-19 in southern Delaware.

    “We’ve seen a significant surge in COVID-19 cases in communities across Sussex County,” said Governor John Carney. “This new testing program is designed to save lives. Over the next week, we will be partnering with local hospitals, the Delaware Division of Public Health, the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services, the Delaware Emergency Management Agency, and the Delaware Department of Agriculture, and others to offer free, rapid coronavirus testing at community testing sites in Sussex County. As the largest employers in Sussex County, we are partnering with the poultry industry to ensure that workers and their families get all of the information they need to be safe and healthy.”

The community testing plan is a three-pronged effort. It includes testing through the use of rapid test kits and ensuring access to care; guidance on isolation and assistance when it is not possible to isolate safely; and education and outreach through the assistance of trusted community partners. Individuals will receive “care kits” with essential materials including hand sanitizer, bandanas, thermometers, and educational materials. Educational materials are being translated into Spanish and Haitian Creole to reach those who do not read English as their first language. These tests are not mandatory.",2020-04-22,2020-04-22,2020-09-03,United States of America,USA,US,Provincial,0,Delaware,NA,Health Testing,General,NA,NA,United States of America,NA,NA,Delaware,NA,NA,13,NA,NA,Voluntary/Recommended but No Penalties,"Provincial/State Government,Other (Please specify in the text box)",53.25802709818432,52.27913752099475,51.50990402083558,62,https://news.delaware.gov/2020/04/22/governor-carney-partners-with-health-providers-and-sussex-employers-on-community-testing-sites-outreach-education/,2020-04-30,2020-04-30T11:57:15Z

The following directives take effect today: o All employees of customer-facing businesses, office-based businesses, manufacturers, nonprofits and construction workers must wear cloth face coverings when they are at work. o Additionally, all customer-facing businesses must take steps to remind customers to wear face coverings. o The only exceptions are for anyone whose health would be in jeopardy because of wearing a face covering or any children under 2 years old. • The RI Artist Relief Fund: The Rhode Island State Council on the Arts (RISCA), in cooperation with the Rhode Island Foundation and the City of Providence Department of Art, Culture + Tourism, announced the Rhode Island Artist Relief Fund today.

SANTA FE – Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced Saturday that houses of worship must now abide by a public health order banning mass gatherings to mitigate COVID-19 spread.

Houses of worship were previously exempt from the public health emergency order banning mass gatherings, defined as five or more people in a single confined space. That order was amended Saturday and can be found here.

In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, many New Mexico congregations had already canceled in-person services before the amended order.

“I am so grateful for the support and cooperation from the vast majority of religious leaders of all faiths who have already made the difficult decision to cancel services in the interest of the health and safety of their members,” Gov. Lujan Grisham said. “I understand the tremendous social and spiritual burden this places on New Mexicans, but ultimately, we must do everything we can to limit the spread of COVID-19, including being absolutely clear that mass gatherings of any type are not permitted in houses of worship,” she said.

Of the 39 states that have implemented stay-at-home orders, only 11 now have exceptions for religious gatherings, and most of those require social distancing at services.

Most New Mexico churches, synagogues and mosques have already ended face-to-face gatherings, and many Christian churches are planning virtual Easter services via livestream, broadcast or other technical means.

“We know that you want to practice your faith, as you should. But this year we must remember that home is holy. The best thing you can do for your community is to stay there,” the governor said. “While this will be emotionally difficult for so many New Mexicans, public health must be the top priority. The only way to slow the spread of COVID-19 is by staying home and minimizing all person-to-person contact.”

The proclamation provides flexibility and relief to courts by removing certain statutory hearing deadlines and service of process requirements as it relates to protection orders, including domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, extreme risk and other similar orders, to ensure access to justice for victims. It also retains the requirement that law enforcement serve such orders when a court orders the seizure of firearms and encourages the use of electronic service and remote hearings, in furtherance and support of the state Supreme Court’s recent order.     
The proclamation also removes restrictions on the ability to pay employees by mail (eliminating, to the extent possible, employees’ need to go to the office to get their check). It allows for shared leave for employees who have not been exposed to the COVID-19 but cannot telework and cannot come into the office due to the ""Stay Home – Stay Health"" order, and waives the requirement that an employee cannot carry over 240 hours of accrued vacation time on their anniversary date, as there are employees who cannot use leave due to participation in activities related to the state’s response.

This responds to an increased need for childcare during the COVID-19 emergency, increasing availability by allowing workers to be more easily licensed to provide care to those who need it.

R_27d2vgDzw9xjk32Dh,9859720,new_entry,original,NA,NA,"Delaware, United States
NEW CASTLE (March 12, 2020) – The Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS) is recommending that all Delaware nursing homes, long-term care facilities and adult day-care centers temporarily end visitation as a way to reduce the risk of residents and clients contracting coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

The recommendation follows the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance that urges long-term care facilities to be vigilant in preventing the introduction and spread of COVID-19. DHSS’ Division of Public Health and DEMA are working with DHSS’ Division of Health Care Quality (DHCQ), Division of Services for Aging and Adults with Physical Disabilities (DSAAPD) and other community partners to implement strategies and restrictions to keep residents safe and healthy. In addition to restricting visitors, DHSS is urging Delaware’s long-term care facilities to:

    Make online methods of face-to face communication and phone calls available.
    Staff should be monitored if they are showing any signs of respiratory infection such as fever, cough or sore throat.
    Any staff member who has these signs or symptoms should not go to work. Any staff that develop these signs or symptoms on the job should immediately stop working, put on a face mask, and self-isolate at home.
    Nursing homes should increase availability of alcohol-based hand sanitizers, tissues, no-touch receptacles for disposal, and face masks at entrances, waiting rooms, and resident check-ins
    Signage should be increased for vigilant infection prevention.
    Properly clean, disinfect, and limit sharing of medical equipment between residents and areas of the facility.

The CDC has found that early data suggests older people are twice as likely to suffer a serious illness from coronavirus disease, also known as COVID-19. Earlier this week, DHSS urged older Delawareans and people with severe chronic health conditions to follow CDC guidance that they “avoid crowds as much as possible” as a way to reduce their risk. Delaware announced its first presumed positive cases this week and the Division of Public Health (DPH) and other state partners are planning for the likelihood of community transmission.

The Department of Health and Social Services advises that community preparedness planning – recommended by CDC – should include older adults and people with disabilities, and the organizations that support them in their communities, to ensure their needs are taken into consideration. Many of these individuals live in the community, and many depend on services and supports provided in their homes or in the community to maintain their independence and their health. For family members and caregivers providing support, the CDC recommends these steps:

    Know what medications your loved one is taking and see if you can help them have extra on hand.
    Monitor food and other medical supplies (oxygen, incontinence, dialysis, wound care) needed and create a back-up plan.
    Stock up on non-perishable food items to have on hand in your home to minimize trips to stores.
    If you care for a loved one living in a care facility, monitor the situation, ask about the health of the other residents frequently and know the protocol if there is an outbreak.

• Do not provide a group meal. Offer sack lunches or have attendees pack their own lunch. 
• Do not share water bottles or utensils. 
• When taking breaks, maintain six feet of distance between individuals while socializing. 
• Keep the number of people near the animal at one time to a minimum, such as having the person vaccinating wait for the person performing castration to step away.
