abstract: "In this paper we present a Bayesian latent variable model that accounts for the bias in COVID-19 cases and tests and enables direct inferences about the causes of the pandemic. We use this model to analyze the effects of hypothesized factors relating to the disease's spread both directly and as mediated by cell phone mobility and fear of the disease. By decomposing these channels of transmission, we can better understand how an array of policy and demographic factors, including partisanship, affected the spread of COVID-19. We show that both Trump vote share in 2016 and racial justice protests are associated with the spread of COVID-19 through increased mobility and decreased concern over the virus. However, there is a pronounced direct effect of Trump vote share that cannot be explained by conventional factors and suggests that the power law distribution of early COVID-19 spread led to a surprisingly durable association between liberal states and the disease.
